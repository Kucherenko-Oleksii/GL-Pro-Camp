# GL-Pro-Camp
My project in GL-Pro-Camp

For my project, I chose the topic of fitness applications, after analyzing analog applications. I decided to create my own mobile application, calling it Fitness-Fox. 
The name of which corresponds to the name of the gym in Chernihiv.

This application will include:

1. Logging;

2. User profile (it will contain all the data about the user, i.e. which exercises they rejected and which ones they completed);

3. Lists with image of the exercise and its description;

4. Swiper, which will contain an image of the exercise for certain areas of the body, 
as well as the corresponding buttons (reject the exercise, postpone the exercise for later, perform the exercise).
